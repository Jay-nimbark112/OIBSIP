<b>Shubhdeep Singh Sidhu alias Sidhu Moose Wala</b> was born on June 17, 1993, in the Moose Wala hamlet of Mansa district. Moose Wala’s fan base was in the millions, and he was well-known for his rap. Moose Wala had an electrical engineering degree. He had studied music in college and had afterwards relocated to Canada.
Shubhdeep Singh Sidhu was a well-known Indian vocalist. He has previously acquired a lot of recognition and has songs that are well-known in the Punjabi business. Sidhu Moose Wala is primarily remembered for his early years, when he was not as well-known. However, he is still recognised by certain singers today. In all of these areas, Sidhu Moose Wala excelled.

Moose Wala was shot dead by unidentified assailants on 29 May 2022; a Canada-based gangster, active in Punjab, claimed responsibility for the killing, which the police said was a culmination of inter-gang rivalry.[16] On 23 June 2022, his first posthumous single, "SYL", was released.

Moose Wala's lyrics and themes were often seen as controversial in India, and he was accused of promoting gun culture and hurting religious sentiments[17]—as was the case related to Mai Bhago, a revered figure in Sikhism.[18][19] He had faced legal challenges for his support of gun culture and his inflammatory lyrics.
